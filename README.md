# Product 3D Control for OpenCart

This module integrates **Three.js** with OpenCart to add 3D model support on product pages. It provides both **admin-side configuration** and **front-end rendering**, allowing store owners to associate 3D models with products for an interactive viewing experience.

> ⚠️ This module is experimental and intended as a starting point for integrating Three.js into OpenCart. It's functional, but not yet polished — improvements are planned.
